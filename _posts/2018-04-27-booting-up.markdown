I've often thought about finding a way to write down some of the things I keep myself busy with it. This is mainly to have some sort of journal for myself, but perhaps someone will find it useful. I always put it off though, because if it is going to be public, there is a lot I must figure out first - you know, to make sure it looks nice and all that. Then I came across [Lawrence Kesteloot's website](https://www.teamten.com/lawrence), and was inspired by his collection of thoughts and projects. I found I enjoyed his site, and thought I would do a similar format.

So, here we go. We'll see how it works out...
