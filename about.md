Hello, my name is Charl. I am a software engineer and sometimes poke my nose into solution architecting.

I enjoy learning and programming in my free time.

I am a thinker.

I enjoy being a doer when I do do, but alas! I do not do as much as I would like.

This site is a collection of things I think about and things I did that I care to share. Read at your own risk.
